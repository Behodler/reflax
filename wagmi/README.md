# Description
We use this directory to autogenerate the necessary inputs in order that wagmi can auto generate react hooks for use in the UI.

## Usage
generateSpec.ts contains a list of contract to use in generating. The file assumes default foundry compile output location.

run

```
yarn wagmi-generate
```

Note: this script assumes reflax-ui is on the same level as reflax and that it is named reflax-ui with the sub directories src/hooks/contracts

### Files
auto.ts is autogenerated and can be ignored
contractSpec.ts is an example file for debugging and can be safely deleted.
generateSpec.ts is the only necessary file in this directory
