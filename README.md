# Introduction
Reflax is a kind of yield aggregator. Users deposit assets that can attract yield in DeFi such as Eth or USDC. The token is deposited into something like Convex or Beefy. On withdrawal or claim, rewards are used to price tilt Flax. The user is then paid in pure Flax plus a premium.

Eg. User deposits 100 Eth which earns 2 Eth in Steth and 10 CRV then by time of withdrawal. Let's say 10 CRV is worth 0.1 Eth. Total reward is 2.1 Eth. This is used to price tilt Flax. Oracle is updated and user is paid 2.4 Eth worth of Flax.
